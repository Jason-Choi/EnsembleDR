# ProjectionEnsemble: Visualizing the Robust Structures of Multidimensional Projections

**Projection Ensemble** is a system designed to identify and visualize robust structures across multidimensional projections.
Although multidimensional projections, such as $t$-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (\tsne), have gained popularity, their stochastic nature often leads the user to interpret the structures that arise by chance and make erroneous findings.
To overcome this limitation, we present a relaxed frequent subgraph mining algorithm and a visualization interface to extract and visualize the consistent structures across multiple projections.
We demonstrate that our system not only identifies trustworthy structures but also detects accidental clustering or separation of data points.
